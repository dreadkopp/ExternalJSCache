# ExternalJSCache
pulls external js and stores them locally, updates within a given time

Since i was tired of waiting for bing and facebooks servers to respond i serve all the js locally.

Since some scripts call other external scripts from within, it can also replace the inline occurences of external scripts
(see specialNeeds array).

Edit the Class to your needs, maybe i'll make it a composer package someday.
